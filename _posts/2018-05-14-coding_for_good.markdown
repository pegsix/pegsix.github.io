As a girl, tech and coders existed in an entirely different universal plane. I saw myself living and working in a walled off world firmly in the humanities. I was someone who loved literature, poetry, and knew I wanted to pursue social work as a career. I got my degree in Social Welfare at UC Berkeley and then a graduate degree in Public Health at Johns Hopkins. It was my dream to build programs and opportunities for underserved communities.

Little did I know that my passion for social work and health equity would lead me to view technology as an important tool for social change. While working in Public Health, I saw firsthand how access to knowledge and information could fundamentally improve the wellbeing of whole communities. Engaging women and girls in building tools to stay healthy and bring voice to their experiences was integral to success in interventions to decrease maternal mortality, prevent illness and infection, and improve overall health outcomes throughout the world. As the world was becoming more connected, and mobile and web became more ubiquitous, tech access and empowerment have become crucial for building stronger health and social infrastructure. 

I created Made By Girls with a goal to improve STEM education and access for girls. This program germinated from my research on the potential for games and tech to improve girls’ lives in developing countries. The UN and World Bank published reports on how girls were the key to changing the world for the better. Educating and protecting girls would improve health outcomes, raise GDP, and build wealth for generations. We know that when girls are invested in and educated, they bring that wealth back to their families and communities. 

Although women and girls serve as a backbone for social change, they have generally not been included in the tech industry. This is leaving out a huge source of knowledge and insight from an industry that is rapidly changing how we run our cities, transportation networks, education, and health. It’s a crucial time for us to decide the world we want to see.

I’m now learning how to code because I spent years trying to show girls that they have the knowledge and could build the confidence to make positive changes in the tech world.  Like many girls, I'd decided that tech was not a realm that I belonged in. Like many girls I lost confidence in myself after 9, particularly in STEM topics. And like many girls, I did not realize that you could be creative, collaborative, and caring using tech as tools for solving the problems you care about. While running my program, I had students build talking calculators to help kids with visual disabilities, create free STEM programs to teach other kids how to code, and design prototypes of braces and aids for kids who had disabilities that impacted their mobility. I saw girls become mentors and leaders for other girls. The community of girls and women that we had at Made By Girls is my biggest pride. I hope to continue to grow as a member of this community and the larger community of technologists who believe we can create stronger ties and better systems that will help people throughout the world reach their full potential.
